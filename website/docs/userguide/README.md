# Install the CLI
We have pre-built the Azure ML CLI as part of this Git repository. Simply run the following commands to set up your CLI environment

```bash
wget uri/where/cli/bits/are
set AZURE_EXTENSION_DIR=path/you/downloaded/to
az ml -h
```

This should show off the new set of AZ CLI commands and you'll be all set to get started.
