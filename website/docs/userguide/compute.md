title: Manage Compute

## Overview

## Managed compute
Azure ML hosts managed compute for running interactive and remote jobs. Jobs run in a fresh instance of a virtual machine that includes commonly-used, preinstalled software. Azure performs all upgrades and maintenance of hosted compute.

You can enable Application Insights telemetry or model telemetry to monitor your web service. The telemetry data is accessible only to you.  It's stored in your Application Insights and storage account instances.	

## Attached compute
Machines you manage and maintain that have been authenticated against your workspace. Attached computes offer more control of hardware, operating system, and software tools than managed compute provide. For more information, see "Attaching compute targets."


If you've enabled automatic scaling, Azure automatically scales your deployment.
